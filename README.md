# Space-invaders-game
turtles shooter game


I developed a Space Invaders game using Python and the turtle module, incorporating object-oriented programming concepts. The game features a player-controlled spaceship that can shoot at enemy turtles that move vertically across the screen. The player earns points for destroying the enemy turtles and loses a life if an enemy turtle reaches the bottom of the screen. This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a graphical game using the turtle module and to apply object-oriented programming concepts in Python.
